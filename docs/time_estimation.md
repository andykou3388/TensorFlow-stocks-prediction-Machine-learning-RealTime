## Recommendations

1. **Start with a phased approach**: Begin with a subset of stocks to validate the system before scaling to all 91 stocks.

2. **Automate wherever possible**: Invest time in automation scripts to reduce daily manual operations.

3. **Maintain detailed documentation**: Keep thorough records of configurations, changes, and performance metrics.

4. **Plan for scalability**: Design the system to handle growth in the number of stocks and complexity of models.

5. **Regular performance benchmarking**: Compare predictions with actual results to continuously improve the system.

6. **Establish alert thresholds**: Set up notifications for system issues to enable rapid response.

This time estimation provides a realistic framework for implementing and maintaining the stock prediction system. Actual time requirements may vary based on system performance, data availability, and market conditions.
